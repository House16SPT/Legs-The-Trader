They continue to ravage any good spots that have a moment of peace left. Considering you brought me those AKs, I think it's high time that these hooligans find out what it means to be a real shooter... and I think you're the one who can get it done. I dont care where you find them. End them.",

I got some info that says he's looking around Customs at the moment. Word of advice: become the predator first. Good luck.

Since you already took care of Reshala, I think I might as well hire you to take out some more of the big fish. Start with this guy... word on the street is, he goes by 'Killa'. I wont lie, the reward's not as great. I'm giving most of it up front with this kitted Mutant. Consider it a signing bonus. I had Mechanic put it together. Happy Hunting!",
